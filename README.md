## Description
Eat Da Burger is an app that helps users track the burgers that they've eaten. Written as an exercise in working with ORM and MVC file structure, the app's simple interface belies a well-organized, efficient codebase. The app and structure were created entirely by me, and the ORM file is intended to be re-useable. All HTML content is generated with Handlebars.

## Installation

The app can be run locally by downloading or cloning this repository from GitHub, installing the required npm packages, and launching the server.js in node.
A hosted version of the app is also available through [heroku](https://safe-gorge-00394.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Enter a burger in the text box, and press submit to add it to your list of uneaten burgers.
Press devour to move a burger to the devoured column.

## Contributing

The front-end page for this project remains a work in progress, and I would welcome improvement/suggestions for that code or to the ORM file.

## Tests

If you wish to fully test the app's database, a seeds.sql file is included along with the schema. The ORM file could also be tested with a different db and controller.

## Questions
